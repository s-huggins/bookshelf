# bookshelf

A wholly original attempt towards a clone of Goodreads, built using a MERN stack. Any data displayed inside the application have been obtained from the public Goodreads API.

## † Update (10/12/2020) †

Unfortunately Goodreads (Amazon) has decided to permanently rm the public API that was integral to the functioning of this project. While it remains deployed at the above link, the project is now lifeless and defunct without API support.
